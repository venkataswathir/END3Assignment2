This assignment is on how backpropagation happens in a neural netwrok

The following are the images of a simple neural network with corresponding inputs, weights and calculations.

And the following images are from excel sheet calculations with different learning rates.
With learning rate as 0.1

The convergence to lower error rate is faster with greater learning rates (for the above considered learning rates)
